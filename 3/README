Mappings created using a (semi)automated procedure to generate high quality mappings between Bio2RDF and SIO. Specifically, Bio2RDF-SIO mappings are inferred 
by mapping Bio2RDF and SIO classes to biomedical ontologies contained in the NCBO BioPortal, and consequently use their hierarchies to find indirect Bio2RDF 
type to SIO class mappings.
